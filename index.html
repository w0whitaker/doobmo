            The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
            entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
            finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
            a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had
            been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for
            the whole party--for though they could not all talk, they could all
            eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches
            soon collected them round the table.

              presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.
            </li>
            <li>“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired.</li>

              “Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the
              maid calls him,” said the officer.
